// PACE Group 1 - Battleship Pseudocode

// Structs: Game Board - array of chars with defined sizes
// 	    Ship       - Size and direction/facing to place on board

// Initialize player and computer boards
// Place ships on computer's board

// Loop until player wins game:
while(!endGame){
   // Output player's board to show hits/misses
   // Accept a set of coordinates from the player
   // Check the coordinates on the computer's board
      // If there is a ship there, update player's board with a HIT
      // If there is no ship, update the player's board with a MISS
   // Compare the player's board to the computer's board
      // If all ship tiles have been hit, end the game
      // Otherwise, continue game
}

// After the game ends, maybe show the computer's board?
